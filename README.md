# Touch_Type_Gang_Switch
This gang switch contains touch switches instead of mechanical switches.

&nbsp;

## Introduction
*Many of the appliances we use in our daily lives are improving due to the current technological revolution.  Accordingly, the mechanical gang switch that has been in use in homes for a long time needs to be upgraded to the current technology.  For that I have upgraded from mechanical switch to touch type gang switch.*
